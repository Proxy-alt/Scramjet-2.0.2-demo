# Overview
- `index.html` - It's the main html file, there it loads the Scramjet scripts and other stuff.
- `script.js` - Initalizes Scramjet
- `config.json` - It's where you make most of your changes
- `sw.js` - The service worker for the project
## Setup
1. You have to add a transport of some kind to `index.html` and add its global object to `config.json`
2. You add your own search logic/styling/etc.
3. Configure the rest of config.json
4. You're finished!
